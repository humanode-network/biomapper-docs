# User Flow

<Steps>
### Welcome Page

The first page that users encounter is a welcome page featuring
the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
Users must agree to these terms and confirm that they are of legal age
before proceeding.

### Face Scan and Liveness Check

Users show their face to the camera. Biometric information is captured and
sent to the CVM via an encrypted channel.
CVM perofms liveness check and matching.
Next, user is prompted to share their _Humanode Identifier_ with
_Humanode Biomapper_, after which _Humanode Biomapper_ stores
the _Humanode Identifier_ in a hashed form known as _Biotoken_
for the duration of the session.

### Signing Page

On the signig page user has to select an EVM address to link their
_Biotoken_ with.
User presses the button to sign the message containing the _Biotoken_ with their
private key, and this signed message is then passed to the _Signig Server_ to
confirm the address and _Biotoken_ ownership.
In response, the _Signing Server_ provides an attestation signature that
can be submitted on-chain.
Then user signs and submits a transaction to the `Biomapper` smart contract
containing a call to the `proveUniqueness` function with the _Biotoken_
and the attestaion signature, resulting in an on-chain record of the user's
uniqueness.
