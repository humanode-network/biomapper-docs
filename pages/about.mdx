# About

<Sub>What is Humanode Biomapper</Sub>

## Humanode Biomapper

Humanode Private On-chain Biomapping a.k.a. Biomapper allows users to map biometric data to their EVM account address. It consists of on-chain and off-chain components. The on-chain part focuses on ensuring the uniqueness of both biometrics and the EVM address, while the off-chain part manages biometrics and general flow.

## Biometrics

Biometric data is handled by Humanode OAuth 2 Service. It uses CVM to check, store, and search for already stored biometrics.

<Callout type="info">The actual biometric data never leaves the CVM.</Callout>

For all other functions, biometrics are uniquely identified by a `Biotoken` assigned by Humanode OAuth 2 Service.

## On-chain components

All smart contracts are described in

[smart-contracts-layout.md](implementation-details/smart-contracts-layout.md)

The on-chain mechanism of validating uniqueness is described in

[proveuniqueness-call.md](implementation-details/proveuniqueness-call.md)
