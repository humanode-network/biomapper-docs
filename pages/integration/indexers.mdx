# Indexers

<Callout type="warning">
__Humanode does not host an official indexer for the `Biomapper` data at this time.__

_It is possible, however, to deploy your own!_

</Callout>

It is possible to index the Biomapper events to obtain the lists of biomapped accounts for a given generation.

You would have to set up something like SubQuery, The Graph, or another chain indexer capable of capturing EVM events.

Use cases for such integration include, for instance, a really simple way to run a Sybil-resistant airdrop without a significant development effort - you just take a list of addresses and run the airdrop! The addresses obtained from the Biomapper are known to have passed the uniqueness check and are therefore non-Sybil, and safe for airdrop distribution.
