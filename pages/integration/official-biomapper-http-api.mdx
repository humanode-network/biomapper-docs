## About Humanode Official Biomapper HTTP API

An official Humanode-maintained HTTP API that can produce signed admissions of uniqueness verifiable on-chain at any EVM-compatible chain.

Coming coon.

## How to use it

### Web 2 style HTTP API

You can use it just like any HTTP API in the Web 2 setting. This way you can easily determine the presence of the biomapping for a given address in the current generation - indicating the passed uniqueness check for the address at the time of the request.

### Web 3 / on-chain use

It is also possible to utilize this API in the Web 3 setting since the API provides signed uniqueness attestations. Such attestations can be submitted on-chain and verified in a smart contract on any EVM-compatible chain.
