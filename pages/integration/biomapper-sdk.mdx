## About Humanode Biomapper SDK

Humanode Biomapper SDK provides interfaces and useful utilities for developing smart contracts and dapps that interact with the Humanode Biomapper smart contracts.

It is usable with any tooling the modern EVM smart contract development ecosystem provides, including Truffle, Hardhat and Forge.

It is open-source and is available on Github, you will find the links to the repo, examples and the generated code documentation below.

## How to use it

You write your own smart contract in Solidity and incorporate the uniqueness check functionality provided by the Biomapper by utilizing the Biomapper SDK.

Leveraging the Biomapper uniqueness checks allows for a strong Sybil-resistance, and enables use cases that were previously unavailable in the setting of the smart contracts - without breaking the pseudonymous nature of the blockchains and privacy-invasive KYC procedures.
