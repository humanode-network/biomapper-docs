# How to Get eHMND Tokens for Biomapping Transaction Fees

## Mainnet

To cover the price and network fees for the Biomapping you'll need eHMND tokens.

There are two ways to get them:

- [Option 1](#option-1) - buy HMND from a Centralized Exchange (CEX) & swap.
- [Option 2](#option-2) - buy HMND on BitMart & Withdraw Directly as eHMND.

### Option 1

#### Buy HMND tokens from a supported centralized exchange

Exchanges where you can buy HMND:

- <A href={tradeLinks.bingx}>BingX</A>
- <A href={tradeLinks.bitmart}>BitMart</A>
- <A href={tradeLinks.kucoin}>KuCoin</A>
- <A href={tradeLinks.simpleswap}>SimpleSwap</A>
- <A href={tradeLinks.coinex}>CoinEx</A>

#### Transfer HMND to your Polkadot wallet or Talisman wallet

Use the <A href={links.humanodeSwap}>Humanode internal swap</A>
to convert HMND to eHMND.

1. Enter your Polkadot/Talisman wallet address starting with `hm...` in
   the _Substrate account_ field.
   You'll need to install the required extension:

   - <A href={links.polkadotExt}>Polkadot wallet extension</A>
   - <A href={links.talismanWallet}>Talisman wallet extension</A>

2. Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask or Talisman) in
   the Ethereum address field.

3. Confirm the swap.
   Your eHMND will be sent to your EVM wallet.

### Option 2

#### Buy HMND on BitMart & Withdraw Directly as eHMND

Buy HMND on <A href={tradeLinks.bingx}>BitMart</A>.

Withdraw HMND directly to your EVM wallet (Metamask or Talisman) that you
are using to Biomap.

This method is quicker since BitMart allows direct withdrawals to an EVM wallet,
eliminating the need for an internal swap.
