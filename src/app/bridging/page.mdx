# Cross-chain Bridging

## What is Cross-chain Bridging

Cross-chain bridging is the capability of Humanode Biomapper that
allows users to prove uniqueness on other Ethereum-compatible
chains beyond Humanode.

## How it works

Biomapper itself runs on Humanode chain. Users first obtain biomap on the
Humanode chain through a face scan and verification process.
Once verified, they can bridge their biomap to other supported blockchains.
This enables DApps on those chains to perform uniqueness checks
on the EVM addresses just as they do on Humanode.


## Technical details

`Biomapper` is a smart contract on the Humanode chain while 
`BridgedBiomapper` is a counterpart contract deployed on each
supported chain. Users transfer their Biomapper state to a
`BridgedBiomapper` contract on another chain.

Developers can access the [Biomapper SDK](integration/biomapper-sdk) to integrate cross-chain
uniqueness verification using APIs.
