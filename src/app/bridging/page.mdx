# Cross-chain Bridging

## What is Cross-chain Bridging

Cross-chain bridging is the capability of Humanode Biomapper that allows
users to prove uniqueness on other Ethereum-compatible chains beyond Humanode.

## How it Works

Biomapper itself run on the Humanode chain. Once verified, they can bridge
their biomap to other supported blockchains (in short).

This allows the dApps on those chains to run on-chain uniqueness checks
on addresses just like it works on the Humanode chain.

## Technical Details

`Biomapper` is a smart contract on the Humanode chain.
`BridgedBiomapper` is a counterpart contract on each of the supported bridged
chains.

The information between those smart contract is transferred by the users.
Any user can bring their Biomapper state to the Bridged Biomapper on
a particular chain.

The API of the `Biomapper` and/or `BridgedBiomapper` smart contracts is
available as part of the [Biomapper SDK](integration/biomapper-sdk).
