# User Flow

<Steps>

### Dashboard Page

When users first access Biomapper, they land on the dashboard page,
which shows their account status and the overall system state.
Here, users can check if they already have a biomap for the current generation.
If they don’t, they can proceed to create one by navigating to the Biomap page.

### Biomap Page

On this page, users must review and accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
They also need to confirm that they are of legal age before continuing.

### Face Scan and Liveness Check

Users undergo a quick face scan to verify their uniqueness:
* They show their face to the camera.
* Their biometric information is captured and securely sent to the
Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) via an encrypted channel for verification.
* The CVM performs; a liveness check to confirm that the user is a real person
and not a deepfake and 1 to n matching to ensure the user isn’t already
in the verified list.
* If successful, users are prompted to share their _Humanode Identifier_ 
with _Humanode Biomapper_.
* The identifier is stored in a hashed form _Biotoken_ for the duration of the session.

### Signing Page

To complete the verification, users must link their _Biotoken_ to an EVM address:
1. Users select their preferred EVM wallet.
2. They sign a message containing the Biotoken using their private key.
3. The signed message is sent to the _Signing Server_,
which verifies ownership of both the EVM address and the _Biotoken_.
4. The Signing Server returns an attestation signature, which
users submit on-chain.
5. Finally, users sign and send a transaction to the 
`Biomapper` smart contract, calling the `proveUniqueness` function
with their _Biotoken_ and attestation signature.
6. This creates an on-chain record proving the user's uniqueness.

### Returning to Dashboard Page

After completing the process, users return to the dashboard page,
where they now have the option to bridge their biomap to
any supported blockchain.
This action is completed directly on the dashboard.
