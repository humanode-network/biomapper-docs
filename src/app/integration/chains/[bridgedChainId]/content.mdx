Integrating with Humanode Biomapper on {props.bridgedChain.generalDisplayName} network.

## Getting Started

First familiarize yourself with core concepts like
[Generations](/generations)
and [General Information](/integration/general-information) about the integrations.

Then, all you need to do is

- write your smart contract that integrated with Bridged Biomapper on
  {props.bridgedChain.generalDisplayName} network, and
- add the link to Biomapper UI on your frontend to let your users obtain
  the biomapping.

## Development

### Smart Contract

Use <DataLink link="biomapperSdkDocs">Biomapper SDK</DataLink> to get
the APIs for smart contracts.

You can use <Code>MockBridgedBiomapper</Code> contract for local development,
and testnet deployment of the <Code>BridgedBiomapper</Code> to real-world
testing.

See technical details at
the <DataLink link="biomapperSdkDocs">Biomapper SDK Docs</DataLink>.

### Frontend

Integrating on the frontend is as simple as adding a link to the Biomapper App.

In general, you can always find the right URL at the [contract addresses] page.

## Rollout

When you are ready, deploy your smart contract
to {props.bridgedChain.generalDisplayName} and connect it to
the Humanode Bridged Biomapper
on <b>{stages[mainStageId].bridged[props.bridgedChainId].displayName}</b>
(see [contract addresses]).

Don't forget to update the link to Biomapper App your the frontend to mainnet Biomapper App.

## After Rollout

If you'd like your app to be listed in the Biomapper App talk to us.
