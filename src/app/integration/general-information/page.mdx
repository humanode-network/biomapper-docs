## About Humanode Biomapper SDK

Humanode Biomapper SDK provides interfaces and useful utilities
for developing smart contracts and dapps that interact with
the Humanode Biomapper and Bridged Biomapper smart contracts.

It is usable with any tooling the modern EVM smart contract development
ecosystem provides, including Truffle, Hardhat and Forge.

It is open-source and is available on Github, you will find the links to
the repo, examples and the generated code documentation below.

## How to use it

You write your own smart contract in Solidity and incorporate
the uniqueness check functionality provided by the Biomapper by utilizing
the Biomapper SDK.

Leveraging the Biomapper uniqueness checks allows for a strong Sybil-resistance,
and enables use cases that were previously unavailable in the setting
of the smart contracts - without breaking the pseudonymous nature of
the blockchains and privacy-invasive KYC procedures.
