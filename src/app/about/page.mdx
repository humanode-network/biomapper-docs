# About Humanode Biomapper

## What is Humanode Biomapper

Biomapper is an on-chain, private facial recognition tool that
makes sure that each verified person can link only one 
EVM-compatible wallet to a dApp. It is built to provide
Sybil resistance to stop fraudsters and scammers from 
tricking your dApp by using multiple accounts and bots.

## Key Features
* ### Quick & Simple Verification

All a user has to do is accept the terms and privacy policy,
go through 15 seconds of facial recognition, and execute the smart contract,
paying a small fee, usually under 1$ in the network’s tokens

* ### Privacy-preserving & Secure

Unlike KYC solutions, the user doesn’t need to share any documents or personal data.
The original video feed/photo never leaves the user’s device.
Anonymized biometric data is encrypted locally on the device,
and then sent to the Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) where it compares the 
new user against all who registered previously. No one has access to the data
inside the CVM ensuring privacy of anonymised facial data.

* ### Cross-chain bridging

Biomap status can be deployed on any EVM-compatible chain by the users,
meaning that dApp developers can run uniqueness checks on EVM addresses
on-chain on any EVM-compatible chain.

* ### High accuracy & security

Humanode has unmatched accuracy levels. The false acceptance rate (FAR)
of 1-to-n search and matching operations is 1 in 125 million. There are
over 60 machine learning and other types of modules dedicated to liveness
detection which make sure that the video feed of the user is real,
not a deepfake or injected video, with a false acceptance rate of 1 in 100 thousand.
Currently, the bounty for a successful attempt of a Sybil attack is $600,000
which no one was able to claim in the last 3 years.
