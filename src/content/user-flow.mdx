# User Flow

<Steps>
### Dashboard Page

The first page that users encounter is the dashboard page that displays
the global system state and the account standing.
Users can check whether they have a biomap in the current generation.
They can choose to proceed to obatin a biomap and navigate to
the corresponding page.

### Biomap Page

Biomap page is featuring the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
Users must agree to these terms and confirm that they are of legal age
before proceeding.

### Face Scan and Liveness Check

Users show their face to the camera. Biometric information is captured and
sent to the CVM via an encrypted channel.
CVM performs liveness check and matching against its local state.
Next, user is prompted to share their _Humanode Identifier_ with
_Humanode Biomapper_, after which _Humanode Biomapper_ stores
the _Humanode Identifier_ in a hashed form known as _Biotoken_
for the duration of the session.

### Signing Page

On the signig page user has to select an EVM address to link their
_Biotoken_ with.
User presses the button to sign the message containing the _Biotoken_ with their
private key, and this signed message is then passed to the _Signing Server_ to
confirm the address and _Biotoken_ ownership.
In response, the _Signing Server_ provides an attestation signature that
can be submitted on-chain.
Then user signs and submits a transaction to the `Biomapper` smart contract
containing a call to the `proveUniqueness` function with the _Biotoken_
and the attestation signature, resulting in an on-chain record of the user's
uniqueness.
After this, user returns to the dashboard page.

### Dashboard Page

Back at the dashboard page, users can now bridge their biomap to any of
the supported chains.
This is done right on the dashboard page.
