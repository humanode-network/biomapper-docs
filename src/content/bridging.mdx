# Cross-chain Bridging

## What is Cross-chain Bridging

Cross-chain Bridging is the capability of the Humanode Biomapper that enables
users to prove their uniqueness on other (i.e. non-Humanode) chains.

## How it works

Biomapper itself run on the Humanode chain, and users first obatin
the biomap in the Biomapper by scanning their face (in short).

Then, users can bridge their biomap to other supported chains.

This allows the Dapps on those chains to run on-chain uniqueness checks
on addresses just like it works on the Humanode chain.

## Technical details

`Biomapper` is a smart contract on the Humanode chain.
`BridgedBiomapper` is a counterpart contract on each of the supported bridged
chains.

The information between those smart contract is transferred by the users.
Any user can bring their Biomapper state to the Bridged Biomapper on
a particular chain.

The API of the `Biomapper` and/or `BridgedBiomapper` smart contracts is
available as part of the [Biomapper SDK](integration/biomapper-sdk).
